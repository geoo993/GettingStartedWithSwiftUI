// SwiftUI and Combine are two new frameworks that were announced at WWDC 2019. SwiftUI was introduced as a revolutionary, new way to build better apps, faster.

class ActivitiesViewModel: ObservableObject { // 13) The ObservableObject (formerlly known as BindableOject) basically allow us to observe changes from our model when used inside a view. so conformance to this allows instances of this class to be used inside views, so that when important changes happen the view will reload.
    @Published var activities: [SwiftUIActivity] // 14) The @Published property wrapper tells SwiftUI that changes to activities should trigger view reloads.
